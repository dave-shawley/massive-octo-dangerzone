class ActArrangeAssertTestCase:

    """
    Base class for testing a single action.

    This class implements the `Act, Arrange, Assert`_ pattern
    that emerged somewhere around 2003.  The idea is simple:
    test implementations should do whatever setup is necessary,
    perform a *single action, precisely once*, and then execute
    logical assertions that constrain the action.

    The :class:`unittest.TestCase` class in the standard library
    implements  a variant of this using :meth:`~unittest.TestCase.setUp`,
    :meth:`~unittest.TestCase.tearDown`, and individual assertion
    methods.  What it lacks is the singular execution as well as
    guaranteed cleanup.  We can abuse the class-level set up and
    teardown methods to ensure that the action under question is
    performed precisely once as well as guaranteeing cleanup.

    While the `Act, Arrange, Assert`_ pattern makes tests much more
    readable, it doesn't necessarily make them easier to use as a
    tool.  The next pattern that is incorporated is the `Single Assert
    Principle`_ which emerged around 2004.  The idea is to make test
    failures very easy to diagnose by ensuring that each test
    case tests a *single logical assertion*.  This isn't strictly
    enforced but it is strongly encouraged.  Each test method should
    include a single logical assertion.  Since the action is executed
    once during the *act* phase, the expense of executing the setup and
    teardown for every test case has been removed.  So, you can include
    lots of test methods that are well-named and contain a single
    logical assertion.
